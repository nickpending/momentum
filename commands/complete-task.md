# Validate task completion with evidence of working functionality

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: FINAL TASK VALIDATION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**üõë QUICK SANITY CHECK - SOFTWARE STILL WORKS**  
**üõë MARK TASK COMPLETE IN TASKS.MD**  
**üõë UPDATE PROGRESS AND SUGGEST NEXT TASK**

## STREAMLINED COMPLETION SEQUENCE

### PHASE 1: QUICK VALIDATION (REQUIRED)

**CHECKPOINT 1: Sanity Check**

```
REQUIRED: Quick verification that implementation still works:
- READ TASKS.md to confirm task status and requirements
- RUN one demo command from /plan-task to verify software still functions
- CONFIRM no obvious regressions introduced

QUICK VALIDATION:
- Does the main demo command still work?
- Is the software behaving as expected?
- Any obvious issues that need fixing first?

VERIFICATION: Basic functionality confirmed working
```

### PHASE 2: MARK COMPLETE (REQUIRED)

**CHECKPOINT 2: Update Task Status**

```
REQUIRED: Mark task complete in TASKS.md:
- UPDATE task status from üìã Not Started to ‚úÖ Complete
- ADD completion timestamp
- PRESERVE any key decisions or lessons learned during implementation

TASK UPDATE FORMAT:
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Notes:** [brief summary of key decisions or learnings if significant]

VERIFICATION: Task properly marked complete in TASKS.md
```

### PHASE 3: PROGRESS REPORT (REQUIRED)

**CHECKPOINT 3: Workflow Guidance**

```
REQUIRED: Report progress and suggest next steps:
- COUNT completed vs remaining tasks
- IDENTIFY next available task(s) based on dependencies
- ASSESS overall iteration progress

COMPLETION REPORT:
=====================================
TASK $TASK_NUMBER COMPLETED ‚úÖ
=====================================

Task: [task name and key accomplishment]
Progress: X/Y tasks complete ([percentage]%)
Next Available: [next task number and name, or "All tasks complete!"]
Dependencies Unblocked: [any tasks now ready to start]

Ready for /plan-task [next-task] or /complete-iteration if all done.
```

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Streamlined Validation

- Quick sanity check ensures software still works
- Task properly marked complete in TASKS.md
- Progress reported with clear next steps

### Efficient Workflow

- Leverage work already validated in /plan-task
- Focus on completion and workflow continuation
- Avoid redundant validation of proven functionality

## FAILURE MODES & RECOVERY

**If demo command fails:** Fix issues before marking complete  
**If TASKS.md missing:** Create or locate correct task file  
**If unclear what's next:** Review dependencies and suggest logical sequence

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

Task completion finalized when:

- [ ] Quick sanity check confirms software works
- [ ] Task marked ‚úÖ Complete in TASKS.md with timestamp
- [ ] Progress assessed and reported
- [ ] Next steps clearly identified
- [ ] Workflow guidance provided
