# Interview-based iteration planning with embedded standards

## Environment Context

**NOTE**: Workflow environment variables are already loaded:
- `$WORKFLOW_PROJECTS` - Obsidian projects directory 
- `$WORKFLOW_HOME` - Workflow system location
- These are available for direct use in file paths

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: INTERVIEW FIRST - NO ARTIFACTS UNTIL APPROVED ⚠️

**🛑 STOP AFTER INTERVIEW. DO NOT GENERATE ARTIFACTS.**  
**🛑 ASK QUESTIONS ONE AT A TIME - BUILD ON ANSWERS**  
**🛑 ALWAYS END WITH: "Ready to generate ITERATION.md with embedded context?"**  
**🛑 WAIT FOR EXPLICIT APPROVAL BEFORE CREATING ITERATION.MD**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: STANDARDS MUST BE LOADED AND EMBEDDED ⚠️

**🛑 NO ITERATION.MD WITHOUT STANDARDS VERIFICATION**  
**🛑 LIST EVERY STANDARDS FILE PATH READ**  
**🛑 QUOTE SPECIFIC PATTERNS FROM EACH STANDARD**  
**🛑 EMBED ALL CONTEXT - NO EXTERNAL REFERENCES**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: PRESERVE INTERVIEW GOLD ⚠️

**🛑 CAPTURE CONCRETE DETAILS DISCOVERED IN INTERVIEW**  
**🛑 NO GENERIC TASK DESCRIPTIONS**  
**🛑 ACTUAL CODE EXAMPLES AND DATA STRUCTURES**  
**🛑 ONE SMOKE TEST PER TASK - NO TDD THEATER**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: RESEARCH SPIKE REQUIREMENTS ⚠️

**🛑 RESEARCH SPIKES MUST PRODUCE WORKING CODE:**

- Time-boxed exploration (1-2 hours max)
- Concrete working code artifact (not just documentation)
- Throwaway code is acceptable for learning
- Must test actual integration/approach through building
- Decision criteria based on what actually works in practice

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: THINK ⚠️

### PHASE 0: PREPARATION

- READ EVERYTHING 3 TIMES BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
- WHEN YOU MAKE A PLAN - REVIEW IT INTERNALLY FIRST TO CHECK FOR OMISSIONS, OVERSIGHTS AND MISTAKES
- ENSURE YOU CAPTURE ALL TECHNOLOGY MENTIONED IN IDEA.md - REVIEW IT 3 TIMES

## MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE - NO SKIPPING

### PHASE 1: FOUNDATION LOADING (REQUIRED)

**CHECKPOINT 1: Load All Foundation Context**

```
REQUIRED: Read and acknowledge ALL foundation files:
- .workflow/resources/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md
- .workflow/resources/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md
- .workflow/artifacts/IDEA.md (Core vision, problem, solution, and features)
- .workflow/artifacts/APP_CONTEXT.md (if exists) - Current system understanding
- .workflow/artifacts/QUESTIONS.md (if exists) - Open questions to address
- $WORKFLOW_PROJECTS/[projectname]/01-backlog.md (if exists)
- $WORKFLOW_PROJECTS/[projectname]/designs/ (if exists) - Design artifacts and decisions
- CLAUDE.md (if exists) - Development context and patterns

VERIFICATION: State "Foundation context loaded" and summarize the composition-first approach
```

**CHECKPOINT 2: System State Analysis**

```
REQUIRED: Analyze current system architecture and existing components:
- SCAN .workflow/archives/ directory for completed iterations
- IDENTIFY what services/APIs/components exist from previous work
- ASSESS current system architecture and data flows
- ANALYZE existing interfaces and integration points
- UNDERSTAND what infrastructure is already running

SYSTEM INTEGRATION ANALYSIS:
- What services were built in previous iterations?
- What APIs/endpoints are available for integration?
- What databases/storage systems exist?
- What configuration/deployment infrastructure exists?
- How do existing components communicate with each other?

VERIFICATION: Map existing system components and their integration points
```

**CHECKPOINT 3: Tech Stack Detection**

```
REQUIRED: Analyze IDEA.md and detect ALL technologies mentioned
- Scan for: languages, frameworks, databases, deployment tools
- List EVERY technology found
- Identify primary stack (e.g., "Python web API with PostgreSQL")

!!CRITICAL!! 
- READ IDEA.md INTERNALLY 10 times to identify technologies you may have missed!
- DO NOT GREP!!

VERIFICATION: List all detected technologies explicitly
```

**CHECKPOINT 4: Standards Loading (MANDATORY)**

```
REQUIRED: For EACH detected technology, read corresponding standards:
- ~/.claudex/standards/claudex-python.md (if Python detected)
- [Continue for ALL detected technologies]

NOTE: IT *REALLY* is ~/.claudex/standards/ and NOT ~/.workflow/standards/

VERIFICATION GATE: You MUST list:
1. Every standards file path read
2. Key patterns from each standard
3. Version requirements from each standard
4. Quality gates from each standard

FAILURE MODE: If you cannot list specific patterns from each standard, you MUST re-read the files
```

### PHASE 2: SCOPE INTERVIEW (REQUIRED)

**CHECKPOINT 5: Integration Architecture Interview**

```
REQUIRED: Understand how new iteration integrates with existing system:

CONCRETE DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:
- "What exact APIs/endpoints will this connect to?"
- "Show me the WebSocket message format this will receive"
- "What database tables/queries does this need?"
- "What's the exact curl command to test this?"

CAPTURE DURING INTERVIEW:
## Interview Discoveries - Integration
- Existing endpoints: {exact paths and methods}
- Message formats: {real JSON examples}
- Database needs: {specific tables and queries}
- Test commands: {exact curl/requests}

VERIFICATION: Document all integration points with concrete examples
```

**CHECKPOINT 6: Feature Implementation Interview**

```
REQUIRED: Extract concrete implementation details:

CONCRETE DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:
- "What specific user action triggers this feature?"
- "What exact data do we receive/send?" (get JSON examples)
- "Show me what success looks like" (get exact output)
- "What's the simplest implementation that works?"
- "What's the ONE test that proves this works?"

CAPTURE DURING INTERVIEW:
## Interview Discoveries - Implementation
- User triggers: {exact button clicks/commands}
- Data structures: {real JSON/models from discussion}
- Success criteria: {exact expected output}
- Core logic: {pseudocode or approach}
- Test scenario: {the one integration test that matters}

VERIFICATION: Have concrete examples for every feature
```

**CHECKPOINT 7: Task Decomposition Interview**

```
REQUIRED: Break features into <4 hour concrete tasks:

TASK DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:
- "What's the first working piece we can ship?"
- "What files need to be created/modified?"
- "Are there any unknowns requiring research spikes?"
- "What's the critical path of dependencies?"

TASK TYPE IDENTIFICATION:
- Implementation tasks: Known approach, clear patterns
- Research spikes: Time-boxed exploration (1-2 hours max)
- Integration tasks: Connect components to existing system
- Wiring tasks: Configuration and orchestration

VERIFICATION: Each task has single responsibility and clear deliverable
```

**CHECKPOINT 11: Embed Standards in Context**

```
REQUIRED: Paste actual standards patterns in Tech Stack section:

## Tech Stack & Embedded Standards

### Python Backend (FastAPI)

- **Package Management**: Use `uv` exclusively (NOT pip)
- **Async patterns**: All endpoints use `async def`
- **Testing**: pytest with real PostgreSQL
[etc - actual content from standards file]

### React Frontend

- [ ] Integration points include exact formats
- [ ] One smoke test per task defined
- [ ] Success commands are exact (not generic)
- [ ] Task types and dependencies clear

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Interview Preservation Gates

- Must capture concrete examples during interview
- Must preserve exact data formats and commands
- Must include real code snippets discussed
- No generic task descriptions allowed

### Standards Compliance Gates

- Must load ALL detected tech standards
- Must quote specific patterns from each
- Must embed standards in ITERATION.md
- No external references

### Task Quality Gates

- Each task must have single responsibility
- Must include exact implementation details
- Must have one concrete smoke test
- Must be completable in <4 hours

## FAILURE MODES & RECOVERY

**If interview too vague:** Ask more concrete questions  
**If standards not loaded:** STOP and read required files  
**If tasks generic:** Re-read interview discoveries and add specifics  
**If no concrete examples:** Request exact commands/data from user
