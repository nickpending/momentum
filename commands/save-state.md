## Next Actions
- [ ] {immediate next step}
- [ ] {following action}
- [ ] {subsequent task}

## Files Touched
- {path/to/file.py} - {what was done/changed}
- {path/to/test.py} - {status: complete/in-progress/started}
- {path/to/config.json} - {what was modified}

## Additional Guidance

- If testing: Include test patterns that work, bugs found, coverage areas
- If planning: Include scope decisions, architecture choices, task breakdowns  
- If exploring: Include experiments tried, promising directions
- If stuck: Include what's been attempted, error messages, hypotheses


## State File Naming

```
.workflow/state/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-N-{timestamp}.md    # When working on a specific task
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ state-{timestamp}.md     # General exploration/discussion
```

Where timestamp is `YYYYMMDD-HHMM`

## Success Criteria

Good state capture enables:

- [ ] Clear understanding of conversation flow
- [ ] Decisions preserved with reasoning
- [ ] Specific next actions identified
- [ ] Technical discoveries documented
- [ ] Easy to resume from any point

## Example Output

````markdown
# State - 2025-01-15-1430

## Context
**Command**: /plan-task 3
**What**: Building WebSocket authentication middleware
**Where**: Implementation phase - core auth working, adding token refresh

## Key Conversation Points
- Discovered frontend expects token in cookie, not header
- User clarified 15-min token expiry is firm requirement
- Breakthrough: can reuse existing session middleware
- Integration point: must emit 'auth' event on connection
- Decided against localStorage due to XSS concerns

## Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Use cookie-based tokens instead of headers
  **Rationale**: Frontend WebSocket client can't set custom headers
  
- **Decision**: Implement token refresh on reconnect
  **Rationale**: Better UX than forcing re-login every 15 min

## Open Questions
- Should refresh tokens be stored in Redis or database?
- How to handle multiple device sessions?
- Rate limiting strategy for refresh endpoint?

## Next Actions
- [ ] Modify auth middleware to check cookies
- [ ] Add refresh token generation to login
- [ ] Create /auth/refresh endpoint
- [ ] Test with frontend WebSocket client

## Files Touched
- auth_service.py - JWT generation complete
- middleware/auth.py - In progress: adding cookie support (line 45)
- api/auth.py - Login endpoint done
- tests/test_auth.py - Basic tests written

## Blockers
- Need to understand frontend's reconnection strategy
- Unsure about security implications of cookie-based tokens

## Development Progress

**Task**: Task 3: WebSocket Authentication

**Built So Far**:
- JWT token generation in auth_service.py
- Basic auth middleware checking headers
- Login endpoint returning tokens

**Currently Building**:
- Cookie-based token validation
- Working in middleware/auth.py line 45

**Working Code**:
```python
# This handles both header and cookie tokens
def extract_token(request):
    if auth_header := request.headers.get('Authorization'):
        return auth_header.replace('Bearer ', '')
    return request.cookies.get('auth_token')
````

**Technical Discoveries**:

- Frontend sets 'auth_token' cookie name
- WebSocket expects 'auth' event after connection
- Session middleware must run before auth middleware
