# Implementation Guidelines - Language Agnostic

Universal principles for building reliable, maintainable software across all programming languages and technology stacks.

---

## 1. Code Organization & Architecture

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module, class, or function should have one clear purpose
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Build capability through component combination, not deep hierarchies
- **Dependency Injection**: Components receive dependencies rather than creating them internally
- **Clear Module Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between components with minimal coupling
- **Standard Project Structure**: Consistent organization patterns within language ecosystems

---

## 2. Type Safety & Static Analysis

- **Type Annotations**: Use language-appropriate type systems (TypeScript, Python hints, Rust types, etc.)
- **Static Checking**: Integrate static analysis tools in development workflow and CI
- **Avoid Dynamic Types**: Prefer compile-time guarantees over runtime type checking
- **Structured Data**: Use proper data structures instead of primitive obsession (strings, integers for everything)
- **Interface Contracts**: Define clear data contracts between components

---

## 3. Configuration & Environment Management

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration, never hardcode values
- **Configuration Validation**: Validate all configuration at startup, fail fast on missing required values
- **Environment Separation**: Clear separation between development, testing, and production configurations
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets, use dedicated secret management systems
- **Default Values**: Provide sensible defaults with explicit override mechanisms

---

## 4. Error Handling & Resilience

- **Explicit Error Handling**: Handle errors explicitly, avoid silent failures
- **Fail Fast Principle**: Detect and report errors as early as possible
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating when non-critical components fail
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always clean up resources (files, connections, memory) properly
- **Retry Logic**: Implement appropriate retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures in distributed systems

---

## 5. Testing Philosophy

### Unit vs Integration Testing Distinction

**Unit Tests: Isolated Component Testing**

- Test individual functions, classes, or modules in complete isolation
- Mock all external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems, network calls)
- Fast execution (typically <100ms per test)
- High code coverage (>90%) with comprehensive edge cases
- Focus on business logic and algorithmic correctness

**Integration Tests: Real System Composition Testing**

- Test that components actually work together through real interfaces
- Use real infrastructure: databases, file systems, network services
- Test actual user workflows and data flows
- Only mock destructive, expensive, or rate-limited operations
- Verify data contracts and system boundaries

### Critical Integration Testing Principles

**DO use real components:**

- Real command-line tool execution
- Real database operations (with test instances)
- Real file I/O with temporary directories
- Real network requests to reliable, fast endpoints
- Real data transformations and business logic

**DO NOT mock your own code:**

- Never mock the components you're trying to integrate
- Never mock business logic or data transformation code
- Never mock standard libraries or well-tested frameworks
- Never create elaborate mock hierarchies that mirror production complexity

**Exception: Mock only when necessary:**

- Destructive operations (email sending, file deletion, payment processing)
- Expensive operations (paid APIs, large computation, external service quotas)
- Non-deterministic services (random data, time-dependent APIs)

## 6. Security Fundamentals

- **Input Validation**: Validate all external input at system boundaries
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions to components
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Secure Defaults**: Default to most secure configuration, require explicit relaxation
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Proper identity verification and access control
- **Audit Logging**: Log security-relevant events for monitoring and compliance

---

## 7. Performance & Scalability

- **Profile Before Optimizing**: Measure actual performance bottlenecks, not assumed ones
- **Appropriate Data Structures**: Choose data structures based on access patterns
- **Resource Management**: Efficient use of memory, CPU, and I/O resources
- **Caching Strategies**: Cache expensive operations with appropriate invalidation
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use async patterns for I/O-bound operations
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Design for distributed deployment when needed

---

## 8. Logging & Observability

- **Structured Logging**: Use consistent, machine-readable log formats
- **Appropriate Log Levels**: Use DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR levels consistently
- **Contextual Information**: Include relevant context (user ID, request ID, component name)
- **No Sensitive Data**: Never log passwords, tokens, or personal information
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs for distributed systems
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Proactive detection of system issues

---

## 9. Documentation & Communication

- **README-Driven Development**: Write README before implementation
- **API Documentation**: Document all public interfaces and data contracts
- **Code Comments**: Explain "why" not "what" - focus on business context
- **Change Documentation**: Document breaking changes and migration paths
- **Runbook Documentation**: Operational procedures for deployment and maintenance
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Document significant technical decisions

---

## 10. Development Workflow

- **Version Control**: Use Git with meaningful commit messages and branch strategies
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed by peers before merging
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing, linting, and security scanning
- **Incremental Development**: Small, frequent changes over large, infrequent ones
- **Feature Flags**: Decouple deployment from feature release
- **Rollback Strategy**: Always have a plan to revert problematic changes

---

## 11. Dependency Management

- **Pin Versions**: Use lockfiles to ensure reproducible builds
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies current for security and performance
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning for known security issues
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only add dependencies that provide significant value
- **License Compliance**: Understand and comply with dependency licenses
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verify integrity of external dependencies

---

## 12. API Design

- **RESTful Principles**: Use HTTP methods and status codes appropriately
- **Versioning Strategy**: Plan for API evolution without breaking existing clients
- **Input Validation**: Validate all API inputs at the boundary
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect APIs from abuse and overload
- **Idempotency**: Design operations to be safely retryable
- **Documentation**: Provide clear, up-to-date API documentation

---

## 13. Database Practices

- **Schema Migrations**: Version-controlled, reversible database changes
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Query Optimization**: Understand and optimize database query performance
- **Data Backup**: Regular, tested backup and recovery procedures
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for database access
- **Data Privacy**: Appropriate handling of sensitive and personal data

---

## 14. Deployment & Operations

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Version-controlled infrastructure definitions
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployment strategies
- **Health Checks**: Automated system health monitoring
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- **Capacity Planning**: Proactive scaling based on usage patterns
- **Disaster Recovery**: Tested procedures for system recovery

## 16. Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **God Objects**: Avoid classes or modules that do everything
- **Magic Numbers**: Use named constants instead of hardcoded values
- **Deep Nesting**: Prefer early returns and guard clauses
- **Copy-Paste Code**: Extract common functionality into reusable components
- **Premature Optimization**: Optimize based on measurement, not assumptions
- **Over-Engineering**: Build what you need now, not what you might need later
- **Technical Debt**: Address code quality issues before they compound
