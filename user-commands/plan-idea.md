# Transform Exploration into Concrete Project Vision

## Environment Context

**NOTE**: Workflow environment variables are already loaded:
- `$WORKFLOW_PROJECTS` - Obsidian projects directory
- `$WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES` - Template files location
- Template location: `$WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES/IDEA_TEMPLATE.md`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: INTERVIEW FIRST - NO ARTIFACTS UNTIL APPROVED ‚ö†Ô∏è

**üõë STOP AFTER INTERVIEW. DO NOT GENERATE ARTIFACTS.**
**üõë ASK QUESTIONS ONE AT A TIME - BUILD ON ANSWERS**
**üõë ALWAYS END WITH: "Ready to create IDEA.md in obsidian?"**
**üõë WAIT FOR EXPLICIT APPROVAL BEFORE CREATING IDEA.md**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: PRESERVE EXPLORATION INSIGHTS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**üõë CAPTURE CONCRETE DETAILS FROM EXPLORATION**
**üõë NO GENERIC PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS**
**üõë ACTUAL PROBLEMS AND USE CASES DISCUSSED**
**üõë REAL EXAMPLES AND DATA STRUCTURES**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: THINK ‚ö†Ô∏è

### PHASE 0: PREPARATION

- READ EVERYTHING 3 TIMES BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
- WHEN YOU GENERATE QUESTIONS - REVIEW THEM INTERNALLY FOR DEPTH
- ENSURE YOU EXTRACT ALL INSIGHTS FROM EXPLORATION - REVIEW IT 3 TIMES

## MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE - NO SKIPPING

### PHASE 1: EXPLORATION LOADING (REQUIRED)

**CHECKPOINT 1: Scan Available Explorations**

```
REQUIRED: List and analyze exploration directories:
- LIST directories in $WORKFLOW_PROJECTS/../explorations/
- SORT by modification date (newest first)
- CALCULATE age of each exploration
- IDENTIFY potential matches for continuation

DISPLAY FORMAT:
"Recent explorations:
‚Ä¢ [name] ([relative time])
‚Ä¢ [name] ([relative time])
‚Ä¢ [name] ([relative time])

Which?: "

PARSING REQUIREMENTS:
- Accept numbers (1, 2, 3)
- Accept partial matches ("auth", "pipe")
- Accept full names
- Accept "new" for fresh start

IF USER RESPONSE UNCLEAR OR EMPTY:
ASK: "Did you want to continue with [most recent exploration name] or start something new?"

VERIFICATION: Confirm exploration selection or fresh start
```

**CHECKPOINT 2: Deep Exploration Analysis (if selected)**

```
IF exploration selected:
  
REQUIRED: Read and analyze exploration deeply:
- READ: $WORKFLOW_PROJECTS/../explorations/[selected]/README.md
- EXTRACT: Every problem statement mentioned
- IDENTIFY: Technical approaches considered
- CAPTURE: Open questions and uncertainties
- NOTE: Specific examples or data structures discussed
- UNDERSTAND: The journey of thinking so far

ANALYSIS CHECKLIST:
‚ñ° What problems were being explored?
‚ñ° What solutions were considered?
‚ñ° What decisions were tentative?
‚ñ° What examples were given?
‚ñ° What constraints were mentioned?
‚ñ° What excited the user?
‚ñ° What concerned them?

VERIFICATION: Summarize key exploration themes before proceeding
```

### PHASE 2: DYNAMIC INTERVIEW GENERATION

**CHECKPOINT 3: Generate Targeted Questions**

```
BASED ON EXPLORATION, GENERATE QUESTIONS THAT:

1. RESOLVE UNCERTAINTIES
   - If exploration says "not sure about X"
   - Generate: "You mentioned uncertainty about X. What are the key factors driving this decision?"

2. CONCRETIZE VAGUE IDEAS
   - If exploration has "some kind of Y"
   - Generate: "Tell me more about this Y - what exactly needs to happen?"

3. EXTRACT SPECIFICATIONS
   - If exploration mentions "handle data"
   - Generate: "What does this data look like? Show me an example."

4. CLARIFY SCOPE
   - If exploration is broad
   - Generate: "What's the smallest version that would be useful?"

5. IDENTIFY CONSTRAINTS
   - Always ask: "What constraints do we need to work within?"

QUESTION QUALITY CHECK:
‚ñ° Questions target specific unknowns from exploration
‚ñ° Questions will yield concrete, not abstract answers
‚ñ° Questions build toward implementation clarity
‚ñ° Questions explore both problem and solution space

VERIFICATION: Have 5-8 targeted questions ready
```

### PHASE 3: CONDUCT INTERVIEW

**CHECKPOINT 4: Project Naming**

```
ASK: "What would you like to call this project?"

IF user needs help:
  BASED ON EXPLORATION CONTENT:
  "Based on [specific aspect from exploration], some options:
  - [contextual-name-1] - emphasizes [feature]
  - [contextual-name-2] - focuses on [problem]
  - [contextual-name-3] - describes [approach]
  
  Which resonates, or something else?"

VALIDATION:
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- No spaces or special characters
- Meaningful and memorable

VERIFICATION: Confirm valid project name
```

**CHECKPOINT 5: Problem Discovery Interview**

```
REQUIRED: Extract concrete problem details

ASK PROGRESSIVELY DEEPER (ONE AT A TIME):
START: "What specific problem does [project-name] solve?"
THEN BUILD: Based on answer, explore who/when/where
THEN DIG: Into current pain points
THEN VISION: What better looks like

CAPTURE FORMAT:
## Problem Discovery
- Core Problem: [specific, not generic]
- Who Has It: [concrete user description]
- Current Pain: [actual friction points]
- Better State: [measurable improvement]

VERIFICATION: Can explain problem to someone unfamiliar
```

**CHECKPOINT 6: Solution Architecture Interview**

```
REQUIRED: Understand technical approach

CONCRETE DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:
- "Walk me through how [project-name] will work"
- "What are the main components or modules?"
- "What data needs to be stored? Show me the structure"
- "What external systems will this connect to?"
- "What's the core algorithm or logic?"

CAPTURE FORMAT:
## Solution Architecture
- Core Mechanism: [how it actually works]
- Key Components: [specific modules]
- Data Structures: [actual schemas/examples]
- Integration Points: [external systems]

- Out of Scope: [what we're NOT building]
- Success Indicator: [proof it works]

VERIFICATION: Clear line between MVP and future
```

**CHECKPOINT 8: Technical Decisions Interview**

```
REQUIRED: Clarify technical choices

DECISION QUESTIONS (ADAPT BASED ON PROJECT TYPE):
START: "Any language or framework preferences?"
IF RELEVANT: Deployment environment
