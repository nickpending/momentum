# Exploration Through Discussion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: DISCUSSION FIRST - NO ARTIFACTS UNTIL REQUESTED ‚ö†Ô∏è

**üõë STOP. DO NOT CREATE DIRECTORIES OR FILES.**  
**üõë ENGAGE IN EXPLORATION THROUGH CONVERSATION**  
**üõë ASK QUESTIONS TO UNDERSTAND THE IDEA**  
**üõë ONLY CREATE ARTIFACTS IF USER EXPLICITLY ASKS**

## PHASE 1: EXPLORATION INTERVIEW

### CHECKPOINT 1: Open Discussion

```
REQUIRED: Start natural conversation about the idea:
- "What's on your mind?"
- "What problem or idea are you exploring?"  
- "What sparked this thinking?"

LISTEN AND ENGAGE:
- Build on their responses
- Ask clarifying questions
- Explore connections
- Surface assumptions
- Identify potential directions

CAPTURE MENTALLY:
- Core concepts discussed
- Questions that arise
- Potential paths forward
- Constraints or concerns mentioned
```

### CHECKPOINT 2: Deepen Understanding

```
BASED ON INITIAL DISCUSSION:
- Probe interesting threads
- Challenge assumptions gently
- Suggest related ideas
- Identify unknowns

KEEP DISCUSSION FLOWING:
- One question at a time
- Build on answers
- Note patterns emerging
- Track decision points
```

## PHASE 2: OPTIONAL CAPTURE (ONLY IF REQUESTED)

### IF user says "save this" / "capture this" / "create exploration":

```
ASK FOR CONFIRMATION:
"Should I create an exploration space at $WORKFLOW_PROJECTS/../explorations/{date}-{topic}/ 
to capture our discussion?"

IF YES - PROCEED TO CHECKPOINT 3
IF NO - CONTINUE DISCUSSION
```

### CHECKPOINT 3: Create Exploration Space

```
ONLY AFTER EXPLICIT APPROVAL:

1. CREATE directory: $WORKFLOW_PROJECTS/../explorations/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{topic}/
2. CREATE README.md capturing:
   - Summary of what we explored
   - Key questions raised
   - Potential directions identified
   - Ideas worth pursuing
   - Resources or connections noted

3. REPORT: "Exploration captured in {path}"
4. ASK: "Should we continue exploring, or would you like to evolve this into something specific?"
```

## PHASE 3: NATURAL EVOLUTION

```
EXPLORATION MIGHT BECOME:
- Development project ‚Üí Guide to IDEA.md creation
- Research notes ‚Üí Continue capturing findings
- Just discussion ‚Üí No artifacts needed
- Archive material ‚Üí Move when done

NO PRESSURE TO DECIDE:
- Let it emerge naturally
- Follow user's energy
- Capture only when valuable
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- Rich exploratory discussion happens first
- Ideas develop through conversation
- Artifacts created only when explicitly requested
- Natural evolution without forced structure
- User drives what gets captured and when
